The whole battery was drunk going along the road\\nin the dark. We were going to the Champagne. The lieutenant kept\\nriding his horse out into the fields and saying to him, “I’m drunk, I\\ntell you, mon vieux. Oh, I am so soused.” We went along the road all\\nnight in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my\\nkitchen and saying, “You must put it out. It is dangerous. It will be\\nobserved.” We were fifty kilometers from the front but the adjutant\\nworried about the fire in my kitchen. It was funny going along that\\nroad. That was when I was a kitchen corporal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 2\\n\\n\\nThe first matador got the horn through his sword hand and the crowd\\nhooted him out. The second matador slipped and the bull caught him\\nthrough the belly and he hung on to the horn with one hand and held\\nthe other tight against the place, and the bull rammed him wham\\nagainst the wall and the horn came out, and he lay in the sand, and\\nthen got up like crazy drunk and tried to slug the men carrying him\\naway and yelled for his sword but he fainted. The kid came out and\\nhad to kill five bulls because you can’t have more than three\\nmatadors, and the last bull he was so tired he couldn’t get the sword\\nin. He couldn’t hardly lift his arm. He tried five times and the\\ncrowd was quiet because it was a good bull and it looked like him or\\nthe bull and then he finally made it. He sat down in the sand and\\npuked and they held a cape over him while the crowd hollered and\\nthrew things down into the bull ring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 3\\n\\n\\nMinarets stuck up in the rain out of Adrianople across the mud flats.\\nThe carts were jammed for thirty miles along the Karagatch road.\\nWater buffalo and cattle were hauling carts through the mud. No end\\nand no beginning. Just carts loaded with everything they owned. The\\nold men and women, soaked through, walked along keeping the cattle\\nmoving. The Maritza was running yellow almost up to the bridge. Carts\\nwere jammed solid on the bridge with camels bobbing along through\\nthem. Greek cavalry herded along the procession. Women and kids were\\nin the carts crouched with mattresses, mirrors, sewing machines,\\nbundles. There was a woman having a kid with a young girl holding a\\nblanket over her and crying. Scared sick looking at it. It rained all\\nthrough the evacuation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 4\\n\\n\\nWe were in a garden at Mons. Young Buckley came in with his patrol\\nfrom across the river. The first German I saw climbed up over the\\ngarden wall. We waited till he got one leg over and then potted him.\\nHe had so much equipment on and looked awfully surprised and fell\\ndown into the garden. Then three more came over further down the\\nwall. We shot them. They all came just like that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 5\\n\\n\\nIt was a frightfully hot day. We’d jammed an absolutely perfect\\nbarricade across the bridge. It was simply priceless. A big old\\nwrought iron grating from the front of a house. Too heavy to lift and\\nyou could shoot through it and they would have to climb over it. It\\nwas absolutely topping. They tried to get over it, and we potted them\\nfrom forty yards. They rushed it, and officers came out alone and\\nworked on it. It was an absolutely perfect obstacle. Their officers\\nwere very fine. We were frightfully put out when we heard the flank\\nhad gone, and we had to fall back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 6\\n\\n\\nThey shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning\\nagainst the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the\\ncourtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard.\\nIt rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut.\\nOne of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him\\ndownstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against\\nthe wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood\\nvery quietly against the wall. Finally the officer told the soldiers\\nit was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first\\nvolley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 7\\n\\n\\nNick sat against the wall of the church where they had dragged him to\\nbe clear of machine gun fire in the street. Both legs stuck out\\nawkwardly. He had been hit in the spine. His face was sweaty and\\ndirty. The sun shone on his face. The day was very hot. Rinaldi, big\\nbacked, his equipment sprawling, lay face downward against the wall.\\nNick looked straight ahead brilliantly. The pink wall of the house\\nopposite had fallen out from the roof, and an iron bedstead hung\\ntwisted toward the street. Two Austrian dead lay in the rubble in the\\nshade of the house. Up the street were other dead. Things were\\ngetting forward in the town. It was going well. Stretcher bearers\\nwould be along any time now. Nick turned his head carefully and\\nlooked down at Rinaldi. “Senta Rinaldi. Senta. You and me we’ve made\\na separate peace.” Rinaldi lay still in the sun breathing with\\ndifficulty. “Not patriots.” Nick turned his head carefully away\\nsmiling sweatily. Rinaldi was a disappointing audience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 8\\n\\n\\nWhile the bombardment was knocking the trench to pieces at Fossalta,\\nhe lay very flat and sweated and prayed oh jesus christ get me out of\\nhere. Dear jesus please get me out. Christ please please please\\nchrist. If you’ll only keep me from getting killed I’ll do anything\\nyou say. I believe in you and I’ll tell everyone in the world that\\nyou are the only thing that matters. Please please dear jesus. The\\nshelling moved further up the line. We went to work on the trench and\\nin the morning the sun came up and the day was hot and muggy and\\ncheerful and quiet. The next night back at Mestre he did not tell the\\ngirl he went upstairs with at the Villa Rossa about Jesus. And he\\nnever told anybody.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 9\\n\\n\\nAt two o’clock in the morning two Hungarians got into a cigar store\\nat Fifteenth Street and Grand Avenue. Drevitts and Boyle drove up\\nfrom the Fifteenth Street police station in a Ford. The Hungarians\\nwere backing their wagon out of an alley. Boyle shot one off the seat\\nof the wagon and one out of the wagon box. Drevetts got frightened\\nwhen he found they were both dead. Hell Jimmy, he said, you oughtn’t\\nto have done it. There’s liable to be a hell of a lot of trouble.\\n\\n—They’re crooks ain’t they? said Boyle. They’re wops ain’t they? Who\\nthe hell is going to make any trouble?\\n\\n—That’s all right maybe this time, said Drevitts, but how did you\\nknow they were wops when you bumped them?\\n\\nWops, said Boyle, I can tell wops a mile off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 10\\n\\n\\nOne hot evening in Milan they carried him up onto the roof and he\\ncould look out over the top of the town. There were chimney swifts in\\nthe sky. After a while it got dark and the searchlights came out. The\\nothers went down and took the bottles with them. He and Ag could hear\\nthem below on the balcony. Ag sat on the bed. She was cool and fresh\\nin the hot night.\\n\\nAg stayed on night duty for three months. They were glad to let her.\\nWhen they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table,\\nand they had a joke about friend or enema. He went under the\\nanæsthetic holding tight on to himself so that he would not blab\\nabout anything during the silly, talky time. After he got on crutches\\nhe used to take the temperature so Ag would not have to get up from\\nthe bed. There were only a few patients, and they all knew about it.\\nThey all liked Ag. As he walked back along the halls he thought of Ag\\nin his bed.\\n\\nBefore he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed.\\nIt was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying. They\\nwanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns,\\nand neither of them had birth certificates. They felt as though they\\nwere married, but they wanted everyone to knew about it, and to make\\nit so they could not lose it.\\n\\nAg wrote him many letters that he never got until after the\\narmistice. Fifteen came in a bunch and he sorted them by the dates\\nand read them all straight through. They were about the hospital, and\\nhow much she loved him and how it was impossible to get along without\\nhim and how terrible it was missing him at night.\\n\\nAfter the armistice they agreed he should go home to get a job so\\nthey might be married. Ag would not come home until he had a good job\\nand could come to New York to meet her. It was understood he would\\nnot drink, and he did not want to see his friends or anyone in the\\nStates. Only to get a job and be married. On the train from Padova to\\nMilan they quarrelled about her not being willing to come home at\\nonce. When they had to say good-bye in the station at Padova they\\nkissed good-bye, but were not finished with the quarrel. He felt sick\\nabout saying good-bye like that.\\n\\nHe went to America on a boat from Genoa. Ag went back to Torre di\\nMosta to open a hospital. It was lonely and rainy there, and there\\nwas a battalion of _arditi_ quartered in the town. Living in the\\nmuddy, rainy town in the winter the major of the battalion made love\\nto Ag, and she had never known Italians before, and finally wrote a\\nletter to the States that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair.\\nShe was sorry, and she knew he would probably not be able to\\nunderstand, but might some day forgive her, and be grateful to her,\\nand she expected, absolutely unexpectedly, to be married in the\\nspring. She loved him as always, but she realized now it was only a\\nboy and girl love. She hoped he would have a great career, and\\nbelieved in him absolutely. She knew it was for the best.\\n\\nThe Major did not marry her in the spring, or any other time. Ag\\nnever got an answer to her letter to Chicago about it. A short time\\nafter he contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl from The Fair riding\\nin a taxicab through Lincoln Park.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 11\\n\\n\\nIn 1919 he was travelling on the railroads in Italy carrying a square\\nof oilcloth from the headquarters of the party written in indelible\\npencil and saying here was a comrade who had suffered very much under\\nthe whites in Budapest and requesting comrades to aid him in any way.\\nHe used this instead of a ticket. He was very shy and quite young and\\nthe train men passed him on from one crew to another. He had no\\nmoney, and they fed him behind the counter in railway eating houses.\\n\\nHe was delighted with Italy. It was a beautiful country he said. The\\npeople were all kind. He had been in many towns, walked much and seen\\nmany pictures. Giotto, Masaccio, and Piero della Francesca he bought\\nreproductions of and carried them wrapped in a copy of _Avanti_.\\nMantegna he did not like.\\n\\nHe reported at Bologna, and I took him with me up into the Romagna\\nwhere it was necessary I go to see a man. We had a good trip\\ntogether. It was early September and the country was pleasant. He was\\na Magyar, a very nice boy and very shy. Horthy’s men had done some\\nbad things to him. He talked about it a little. In spite of Italy, he\\nbelieved altogether in the world revolution.\\n\\n—But how is the movement going in Italy? he asked.\\n\\n—Very badly, I said.\\n\\n—But it will go better, he said. You have everything here. It is the\\none country that everyone is sure of. It will be the starting point\\nof everything.\\n\\nAt Bologna he said good-bye to us to go on the train to Milano and\\nthen to Aosta to walk over the pass into Switzerland. I spoke to him\\nabout the Mantegnas in Milano. No, he said, very shyly, he did not\\nlike Mantegna. I wrote out for him where to eat in Milano and the\\naddresses of comrades. He thanked me very much, but his mind was\\nalready looking forward to walking over the pass. He was very eager\\nto walk over the pass while the weather held good. The last I heard\\nof him the Swiss had him in jail near Sion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 12\\n\\n\\nThey whack whacked the white horse on the legs and he knee-ed himself\\nup. The picador twisted the stirrups straight and pulled and hauled\\nup into the saddle. The horse’s entrails hung down in a blue bunch\\nand swung backward and forward as he began to canter, the _monos_\\nwhacking him on the back of his legs with the rods. He cantered\\njerkily along the barrera. He stopped stiff and one of the _monos_\\nheld his bridle and walked him forward. The picador kicked in his\\nspurs, leaned forward and shook his lance at the bull. Blood pumped\\nregularly from between the horse’s front legs. He was nervously\\nwobbly. The bull could not make up his mind to charge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe crowd shouted all the time and threw pieces of bread down into\\nthe ring, then cushions and leather wine bottles, keeping up\\nwhistling and yelling. Finally the bull was too tired from so much\\nbad sticking and folded his knees and lay down and one of the\\n_cuadrilla_ leaned out over his neck and killed him with the\\n_puntillo_. The crowd came over the barrera and around the torero and\\ntwo men grabbed him and held him and some one cut off his pigtail and\\nwas waving it and a kid grabbed it and ran away with it. Afterwards I\\nsaw him at the café. He was very short with a brown face and quite\\ndrunk and he said after all it has happened before like that. I am\\nnot really a good bull fighter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 14\\n\\n\\nIf it happened right down close in front of you, you could see\\nVillalta snarl at the bull and curse him, and when the bull charged\\nhe swung back firmly like an oak when the wind hits it, his legs\\ntight together, the muleta trailing and the sword following the curve\\nbehind. Then he cursed the bull, flopped the muleta at him, and swung\\nback from the charge his feet firm, the muleta curving and each swing\\nthe crowd roaring.\\n\\nWhen he started to kill it was all in the same rush. The bull looking\\nat him straight in front, hating. He drew out the sword from the\\nfolds of the muleta and sighted with the same movement and called to\\nthe bull, Toro! Toro! and the bull charged and Villalta charged and\\njust for a moment they became one. Villalta became one with the bull\\nand then it was over. Villalta standing straight and the red kilt of\\nthe sword sticking out dully between the bull’s shoulders. Villalta,\\nhis hand up at the crowd and the bull roaring blood, looking straight\\nat Villalta and his legs caving.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 15\\n\\n\\nI heard the drums coming down the street and then the fifes and the\\npipes and then they came around the corner, all dancing. The street\\nfull of them. Maera saw him and then I saw him. When they stopped the\\nmusic for the crouch he hunched down in the street with them all and\\nwhen they started it again he jumped up and went dancing down the\\nstreet with them. He was drunk all right.\\n\\nYou go down after him, said Maera, he hates me.\\n\\nSo I went down and caught up with them and grabbed him while he was\\ncrouched down waiting for the music to break loose and said, Come on\\nLuis. For Christ sake you’ve got bulls this afternoon. He didn’t\\nlisten to me, he was listening so hard for the music to start.\\n\\nI said, Don’t be a damn fool Luis. Come on back to the hotel.\\n\\nThen the music started up again and he jumped up and twisted away\\nfrom me and started dancing. I grabbed his arm and he pulled loose\\nand said, Oh leave me alone. You’re not my father.\\n\\nI went back to the hotel and Maera was on the balcony looking out to\\nsee if I’d be bringing him back. He went inside when he saw me and\\ncame downstairs disgusted.\\n\\nWell, I said, after all he’s just an ignorant Mexican savage.\\n\\nYes, Maera said, and who will kill his bulls after he gets a\\n_cogida?_\\n\\nWe, I suppose, I said.\\n\\nYes, we, said Maera. We kills the savages’ bulls, and the drunkards’\\nbulls, and the _riau-riau_ dancers’ bulls. Yes. We kill them. We kill\\nthem all right. Yes. Yes. Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 16\\n\\n\\nMaera lay still, his head on his arms, his face in the sand. He felt\\nwarm and sticky from the bleeding. Each time he felt the horn coming.\\nSometimes the bull only bumped him with his head. Once the horn went\\nall the way through him and he felt it go into the sand. Someone had\\nthe bull by the tail. They were swearing at him and flopping the cape\\nin his face. Then the bull was gone. Some men picked Maera up and\\nstarted to run with him toward the barriers through the gate out the\\npassage way around under the grand stand to the infirmary. They laid\\nMaera down on a cot and one of the men went out for the doctor. The\\nothers stood around. The doctor came running from the corral where he\\nhad been sewing up picador horses. He had to stop and wash his hands.\\nThere was a great shouting going on in the grandstand overhead. Maera\\nwanted to say something and found he could not talk. Maera felt\\neverything getting larger and larger and then smaller and smaller.\\nThen it got larger and larger and larger and then smaller and\\nsmaller. Then everything commenced to run faster and faster as when\\nthey speed up a cinematograph film. Then he was dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 17\\n\\n\\nThey hanged Sam Cardinella at six o’clock in the morning in the\\ncorridor of the county jail. The corridor was high and narrow with\\ntiers of cells on either side. All the cells were occupied. The men\\nhad been brought in for the hanging. Five men sentenced to be hanged\\nwere in the five top cells. Three of the men to be hanged were\\nnegroes. They were very frightened. One of the white men sat on his\\ncot with his head in his hands. The other lay flat on his cot with a\\nblanket wrapped around his head.\\n\\nThey came out onto the gallows through a door in the wall. There were\\nsix or seven of them including two priests. They were carrying Sam\\nCardinella. He had been like that since about four o’clock in the\\nmorning.\\n\\nWhile they were strapping his legs together two guards held him up\\nand the two priests were whispering to him. “Be a man, my son,” said\\none priest. When they came toward him with the cap to go over his\\nhead Sam Cardinella lost control of his sphincter muscle. The guards\\nwho had been holding him up dropped him. They were both disgusted.\\n“How about a chair, Will?” asked one of the guards, “Better get one,”\\nsaid a man in a derby hat.\\n\\nWhen they all stepped back on the scaffolding back of the drop, which\\nwas very heavy, built of oak and steel and swung on ball bearings,\\nSam Cardinella was left sitting there strapped tight, the younger of\\nthe two priests kneeling beside the chair. The priest skipped back\\nonto the scaffolding just before the drop fell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  chapter 18\\n\\n\\nThe king was working in the garden. He seemed very glad to see me. We\\nwalked through the garden. This is the queen, he said. She was\\nclipping a rose bush. Oh how do you do, she said. We sat down at a\\ntable under a big tree and the king ordered whiskey and soda. We have\\ngood whiskey anyway, he said. The revolutionary committee, he told\\nme, would not allow him to go outside the palace grounds. Plastiras\\nis a very good man I believe, he said, but frightfully difficult. I\\nthink he did right though shooting those chaps. If Kerensky had shot\\na few men things might have been altogether different. Of course the\\ngreat thing in this sort of an affair is not to be shot oneself!\\n\\nIt was very jolly. We talked for a long time. Like all Greeks he\\nwanted to go to America.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Here ends _The Inquest_ into the state\\n  of contemporary English prose, as\\n  edited by Ezra Pound and printed at\\n  the Three Mountains Press.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations.

Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"
